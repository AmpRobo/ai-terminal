# Factory MCP

The canonical Factory workflow is served by the connected `ai-terminal-factory` MCP
server so its instructions stay synchronized with the live tool schemas.

Before invoking a Factory MCP tool:

1. Confirm the `ai-terminal-factory` server and its tools are available. If they are
   unavailable, stop and tell the user that Factory MCP must be connected and
   authenticated.
2. Read `skill://ai-terminal/factory-mcp/SKILL.md`, then follow the returned skill and
   its referenced resources. If the skill cannot be read, use the server
   instructions and live tool descriptions.

Treat live tool descriptions and input schemas as authoritative.
